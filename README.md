# Security-Risk-Register-Template

ðŸŽ‰ **How to use this template**

A risk register is the building block of most security programs. There are several ways to organize and maintain your risk register, such as an enterprise risk register or a physical security risk register. This template focuses on information security risks. There is more than one way to form your risk register and calculate risk scoring. Talha and I are big fans of risk quantification, but the idea was to start with a simple risk register and share that with the audience. 

Please note that these templates are highly flexible and can be tailored to your needs. Feel empowered to make a copy and modify it for your audience. If you already have existing templates (which we hope you do), feel free to incorporate any helpful elements.
